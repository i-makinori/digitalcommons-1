With partners, I am currently trying to start a "digital commons movement", if you will, a community where people learn together and rebuild a new collaborative society based on partnership of the equals, and I stress this term equal partnership - zero hierarchy, zero "come back later when you know know how to ask better questions", zero knowledge worshipping, zero founder, zero leadership - initially focused on the digital domain to bootstrap the movement.

In such a community, yes, any question, suggestion or statement will be welcome!  They are not only welcome but will probably form the backbone of the society.

Erica's really good points and many others we discussed here such as the twitter replacement, make me think that time is ripe for this.

In the community I am thinking of, Free Software will be an important part but it will not be the end goal or the most dominant focus.

Rather, Free Software will be a natural choice, because the software requirements of the community will require that kind of licensing as the bare minimum standard.

But it won't be just married to Free Software, either.   The software licensing is just a part its concern and it will also have discussions of how to take advantage of proprietary systems.

IPhone maybe a totally locked system but it doesn't stop us from accessing homepages built with Free Software.   Windows is proprietary but WSL2 makes available a Linux subsystem on top of it.

Gradually transitioning from Proprietary to Free is a perfectly good strategy, in my opinion.  If I may add, what else is a proprietary system good for, other than to make the transition to the Free? 

If anyone reading this is interested, you can contact me personally ðŸ˜„  - let's make it happen!
