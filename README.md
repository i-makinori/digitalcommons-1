# digitalcommons
provisional name

## Anyone genuienly intested is eligible for maximum permission (admin, etc)

## Some Git related traffic rules

### (if there are better ideas please suggest and let's decide together!)

- Anyone can commit straight away  - no need for moderation or asking for permissions

- 'Linear History' is Required.  The intention is similar to above, to simplify the process and maximize commit freedom

- When mistakes are made, unless too severe, we prefer to 'git revert' and commit the cancellation, rather than really going back, which will require considerable coordination

- We will refine these rules over time

## Licensing/Copyrights
The intention is we create the 'digital commons' with a huge emphasis on Equal Partnership of the participants.  One person one vote.  Anyone who agrees with this principle is welcome to join.

As such, the only 'license' that makes sense is the Freest, Least Restricive one, if a 'license' is required at all.

We will collectively refine this over time!
