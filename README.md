## Anyone genuienly intested is eligible for maximum permission (admin, etc)

## Some Git related traffic rules

### (if there are better ideas please suggest and let's decide together!)

- Anyone can commit straight away  - no need for moderation or asking for permissions

- 'Linear History' is Required.  The intention is similar to above, to simplify the process and maximize commit freedom

- When mistakes are made, unless it is too severe, we prefer to 'git revert' and commit the cancellation, rather than really going back, which will require considerable coordination
